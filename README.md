Welcome to Aerith's Flower Shop!

This is an automated chatbot that will assist you in ordering flowers from an online store. This chatbot demonstrates that all customer interactions can be handled by the chatbot, including initiating the order, choosing the type of flowers, storing the recipient name, and setting the date and time of the delivery. Anything outside of the flower delivery conversation will be handled by exceptions to ask the customer to clarify their intent. 

In tribute of the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this chatbot was created with Aerith's theme. Aerith is a main character in the game, whose initial role was a flower girl in the city of Midgar. Her signature flower is the yellow lily, which is the first choice when the user initiates a flower delivery order. The accompanying background music is Aerith's theme song.

This chatbot is powered by a combination of AWS Lex | Lambda | Cognito | S3. This chatbot is solely for demo purposes.
